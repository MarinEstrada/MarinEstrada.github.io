By [Adrian Marin Estrada]

My online portfolio with all my relevant projects skills to provide clear context of my computational abilities. To view the deployed site, please visit [https://marinestrada.github.io/][deployed_site]

For reference I used a [video by GeekProbin on youtube][reference_vite] in order to create my site, and expanded upon it based off my personal needs.
